## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- BEM Naming Convention
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpack

### What I learned

In this project, I was more focused on improving my process, how I do things from start to end. I believe that I have improved my development process as I was more productive and more efficient with my time with this project. I have applied my knowledge about CSS Grid and Flexbox. I have also used JavaScript's ES6 import and export modules to have a separation of concerns, for easier maintenance. I have also taken into practice form validation and dom manipulation. Overall, this project was an application of my existing knowledge and I'm very proud. :)

### Continued development

I would love to create more Front-End Mentor projects, whilst incorporating the best practices and trying out new technologies.
